pandas-challenge analysis
1. In summary, the analysis is bringing our attention to the factors that contribute to the overall performance of a school. In this case, “performance” is defined as the number of students that are passing math and reading. In many cases, the conclusion is counterintuitive, such as the fact that schools with higher budgets perform worse than schools with lower budgets.
2. There appears to be no relationship between the grade level of students and their performance. Due to college admissions, I would expect students in the 11th and 12th grade to perform better than their younger counterparts. However, the performance of students seems to be consistent at each school, regardless of the grade level.
3. The performance of students in math seems to be more easily influenced by the size of the school. In the “size_summary” dataframe, we can see that 69.96% of students attending a large school are passing math, compared to 82.77% who are passing reading. I would be interested to see what factors are contributing to this phenomena. Possible factors could be fewer math teachers, which means larger math classes, or too few textbooks.
